# Discretization-Invariant-Learning-for-Reconstructed-Images
These codes explored the comparison, adaptability, and effectiveness of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the domain of image deblurring, particularly in the context of discretization invariance. Throughout the investigation, a comprehensive analysis was conducted across various dimensions of the MNIST dataset, focusing on multiple aspects, including kernel comparison, error metrics, and differentiability measures, utilizing Sobolev and Fréchet norms.
The results showed that the FNO demonstrated superior performance in reconstruct- ing deblurred images compared to the CNN across numerous tests. FNO consistently yielded lower L2 and L∞ errors, indicating its robust capacity to handle high-frequency details and retain essential structural features.
The research effectively established a robust comparative framework between FNO and CNN, providing clear insights into their performance across different loss functions and metrics.It was successfully demonstrated that FNOs outperform traditional CNNs in terms of adaptability to discretization changes, which can lay the groundwork for their application in more complex, real-world scenarios.The insights gained from this research contribute to the growing body of literature advocating for the use of Fourier-based methods in machine learning, potentially influencing future research directions in image processing and beyond.
